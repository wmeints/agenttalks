# Approach and objectives

This section covers the approach to the solution and key objectives that we want to 
achieve.

## Providing an insightful summary of content

Our first objective for agenttalks is to provide an insightful summary of the content
we found online. We want a summary that's actionable rather than just informational.
The agenttalks application should extract key insights.

## Providing a pleasant medium for conveying information

The second objective for agenttalks is to provide a pleasant way to get information to us.
We find that reading is useful if you want in-depth knowledge. Audio is much more suitable
for shorter pieces of information while you're doing other things like driving your car.

We figure that since we like listening to podcasts that having a podcast that gives us
a nice overview of the content for the past week is a great way of getting through the
articles that we found.
