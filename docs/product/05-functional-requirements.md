# Functional requirements

This section covers how we approach functional requirements in our solution.

## Recording functional requirements

We record functional requirements as issues on Github. We think this provides a much
more actionable way of documenting what we made. Though we also know that this means
that as we progress, it will be harder to figure out how things are supposed to work.

## Feature files

We record feature files with the various modules in the solution to help specify how
specific pieces should work. The issues on Github will be leading initially, but once
we've recorded the scenarios in feature files, those will provide the single source of
thruth for the application's behavior.
