# Acceptance criteria

This section covers the acceptance criteria for the solution. We'll consider our work
successful when these criteria are met.

## Podcast is available on buzzsprout

The key to success is the availability of our podcast on buzzsprout. We want to listen
to the podcast through our favorite podcast app. We also want to be able to share the 
podcast with family and friends.

## We get useful information out of the podcast

The application is only useful when we get information that we find useful. This is a
rather subjective requirement that we'll need to refine some more over time. For the 
initial version of the app it's important we have a faithful summary of content and
a podcast that's pleasant to listen to. We'll improve the summaries over time once we
learn what makes a useful summary for us.
