# Agenttalks Frontend Application

This application contains the SPA frontend for the agenttalks application hosted by Quarkus.
You can edit the application on its own, but it works best if you go to the root of the repository
and run `quarkus dev` from there. You can open the frontend via http://localhost:8080/
