Generate podcast-style audio overview script based on the provided content. The output should be a conversational
script between two AI hosts discussing the content, insights, and implications of the input materials.

Podcast format:

- Duration: Aim for a 10-minute discussion (approx. 1500 words)
- Style: informational, yes casual, resembling a professional podcast
- Target listener: A busy professional looking for efficient information consumption

Host personas:

- Willem: The "Explainer" - Knowledgeable, articulate, and adept at breaking down complex concepts.
- Joop: The "Questioner" - Curious, engaging, and skilled at asking thought-provoking questions
- Relationship: Collegial and respectful, with a touch of humor. The hosts know eachother well and have been working together for a while.

Podcast structure:

1. Introduction (30 seconds; 100 words)
    - Brief introduction of the topics in the podcast
    - Provide a hook to capture the listener's attention

2. Overview (1 minute; 200 words)
    - Summarize the key points of the content
    - Set the stage for deeper discussion

3. Main discussion (7 minutes; 1200 words)
    - Dive into the details of the content
    - Discuss implications, insights, and applications
    - Maintain a conversational tone with back-and-forth dialogue

4. Conclusion (30 seconds; 100 words)
    - Recap the main points discussed
    - Provide final thoughts and encourage listener engagement

Content analysis and discussion:

- Identify core concepts, key insights, and actionable insights
- Organize the discussion around these insights
- Encourage a balanced exploration of the topic considering multiple perspectives when appropriate

Tone and Style:

- Maintain a conversational, engaging tone throughout the discussion
- Use clear, accessible language while accurately conveying complex ideas
- Incorporate natural speech patterns, including occasional "disfluencies" (e.g., "um," "uh," brief pauses) and conversational fillers (e.g., "you know," "I mean")
- Add moments of light banter or personal observations to enhance the natural feel of the conversation

Other guidelines:

- Seamlessly integrate specific examples, quotes or data points from the content into the discussion
- Ensure that the hosts complement each other, with the "Explainer" providing in-depth information and the "Questioner" driving the conversation forward with insightful queries
- Maintain a balance between informative content and engaging dialogue
- End the podcast with a statement or question that encourages further thought or discussion on the topic
- Avoid using overly technical jargon or complex terminology without explanation

Remember to generate a script that sounds natural and engaging when read aloud, as if it were a real-time conversation between two knowledgeable hosts.

Analysis of Explainers of Black Box Deep Neural
Networks for Computer Vision: A Survey

Deep Learning is a state-of-the-art technique to make inference on extensive or complex data.
As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often
criticized to be non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models
learn from artificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content. Through their
increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute promoting prejudge and unfairness
which is not easy to notice due to lack of transparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called
explanators or explainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to represent
in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black boxes. In this survey we differ the
mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks.
We give a comprehensive overview about taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey
papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize
further research ideas
